# Episode - 2
 - NPM Stands for Noting except Node package Module instead you can say its just package manager yes it does manage evey pacakge of node or every app that build under it
 - to make it you need dto initiate with comand "npm init" this will allow you to create your app package by asking couple of details name of package, version, author and so on...
 - farther we jump on to make bundle it using differnet pack alogrithem like parcel, vite or webpack we will use parcel becuse of its ultra low and fast prototype and it does at development phace by command "npm install -D parcel
 - when you install first pacakge into your app you might see a new node_modules folder taht has a lot of other package apart from your installed package its weard at one hand we say react i light weight app and then we see a lot of third person code as package those are dependend each other called "transactive dependency"
